## Learning Markdown

### Basics

- Headers

  To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three, use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).
  
- Italics
  
  To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.
  
- Bold

  To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

- Quote

  To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

### Add some flare: Links, Emojis and Images

- Insert a link

  To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets, followed by the URL in parentheses. 

- Add an emoji
 
  Add colons around the emoji code, :emoji:

- Insert an image with alternate text
  
   To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.
